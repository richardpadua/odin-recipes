        <p>This is the way I make my base for Overnight Oats! This allows
            me to add any other toppings in order to create diversity in what I eat, 
            and is tasty on its own.
        </p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour all dry ingredients (oats, chia seeds, and protein) into mason jar.
                I personally like to layer them to make it look more aesthetically pleasing.

            <li>Add greek yogurt.</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together.</li>
            <li>In between these steps you can add your favourite fruits, or any other ingredients 
                you want to make your overnight oats taste the way you want them too.
